# Optimization 

This was a project for a class that focused on the optimization of an abstract problem written in MIPS assembly. The problem description can be found in the file “Fall19_Project1.pdf”. The project was graded based on three criteria: Registers used, Static Instructions, and Average Instructions Run. My implementation was the third best in a class of over 100 students and was the best by number of registers used. My solution used only 4 unique registers while the next closest solution utilized 7.
