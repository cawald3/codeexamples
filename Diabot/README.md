# Diabot

The Diabot was my senior design project. The Diabot was intended for use in warehouses to remotely inspect racking installations and alert users to installation problems so they could be fixed before causing problems. To do this, the robot would need to wirelessly communicate with a ground station to receive commanding and send back basic health information about the robot. The microcontroller board used for this project was a LAUNCHXL-CC1352P from Texas Instruments. The two files in this directory were used on the base station MCU and robot MCU.
