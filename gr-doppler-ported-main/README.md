# GR-Doppler

This is a work in progress project that I am currently working on. I only started on this about 2 weeks ago and havenâ€™t had too much time to work on this due to Lunar Flashlight. This is for the GT-Ground station network that I am a part of. This is an OOT module for gnuradio that will calculate the doppler shift of a satellite and apply a correction factor to the IQ samples. It could also be used on the transmission side to apply a correction on the transmission to allow the satellite to see the signal at the correct frequency.
I have mainly worked on the two files named cc.py and tle_cc.py in the python folder. Most of the other files were autogenerated by the modtool used by gnuradio. This project also makes uses of pipenv to enable development across multiple environments and maintain a list of dependencies.
