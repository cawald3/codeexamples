# Stepper Motor Song

This project was for a final project for my embedded systems class. I wanted to recreate a system that played music using stepper motors.  There are several videos on youtube of systems like this but I wanted to create my own. 

For this project, I used a matlab script to read in a midi file of the song I wanted to play and converted it to a csv file that had the note pitch, start times, and end times for each note. I would keep all of these files on a SD file system and the user could use a Bluetooth interface to select which song to play on the motors. 

The video file shows the system working as a final demo.

This project was run on a LPC1768
